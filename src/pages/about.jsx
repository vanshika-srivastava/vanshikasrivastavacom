              Hi, Iâ€™m Vanshika! Tech Evangelist and a developer without engineering degree - mostly by choice.

              <p>
                I began my journey in tech around 2020. At that point of time, I didn't know about open source or
                technically anything of how I would land 'my first job in tech'. I completed my 12th grade
                in commerce and along with CS/IT as my additional subject. I was pretty darn sure that I wanted to work
                in field of finance and tech. Fintech was still in its early age and remote work was just getting its actual meaning.


              </p>
              <p>
                I loved the idea of how finance could always leverage tech - using python you could predict data, or just graph them out, etc.
                As of today,I'm glad I took a leap of faith and gave in. I started off with open source communities, contributed
                as non-tech person by helping community folks around cloud native space, writing or organising some online events. That gave me exposure to understand how
                generally open source contributions and collaborations work.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end of 2022, I transitioned to Web3, an intersection of finance, technology and most importantly open source.
                I worked at Biconomy - which is a Full Stack Account Abstraction SDK focused around smart account implementation.
                I had my fair set of experience building usecases and demo applications, while learning more on AA, defi and web3 in general.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have worked with multiple developer first products, couple of SaaS platforms and built a healthy personal brand who
               strongly advocate around Open Source, Web3 and Developer Experience. I enjoy backend more than frontend but my super-power is
               that I can connect the dots very well when it comes to code, and explain the concepts to you like a 5 year old!
